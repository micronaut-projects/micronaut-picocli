If your service has a lot of functionality, a common pattern is to have subcommands to control different areas of the service.
To allow Micronaut to inject services and resources correctly into the subcommands,
make sure to obtain subcommand instances from the `ApplicationContext`, instead of instantiating them directly.

The easiest way to do this is to declare the subcommands on the top-level command, like this:

.A top-level command with subcommands

snippet::io.micronaut.picocli.docs.subcommand.TopCommand[tags="imports,class"]

<1> The top-level command has two subcommands, `SubCmd1` and `SubCmd2`.
<2> Let all commands in the hierarchy implement `Runnable` or `Callable`.
<3> Start the application with `PicocliRunner`. This creates an `ApplicationContext` that instantiates the commands and performs the dependency injection.
