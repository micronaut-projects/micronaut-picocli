Occasionally you may want to set parser options or otherwise customize picocli behavior.
This can easily be done via the setter methods on the picocli `CommandLine` object, but the `PicocliRunner` does not expose that object.

In such cases, you may want to invoke picocli directly instead of using the `PicocliRunner`.
The code below demonstrates how to do this:

<1> Instantiate a new `ApplicationContext` for the `CLI` environment, in a try-with-resources statements, so that the context is automatically closed before the method returns.
<2> Pass a `MicronautFactory` with the application context to the picocli `CommandLine` constructor. This enables dependencies to be injected into the command and subcommands.
<3> An example of configuring the picocli command line parser.
<4> An example of configuring the picocli usage help message.
<5> Execute the command and return the result (this closes the application context).
<6> Optionally call `System.exit` with the returned exit code.
